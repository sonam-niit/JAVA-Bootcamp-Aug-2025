class: Template or Blueprint
	which includes all member variables and member functions (methods)

Object: Instance of class which can access all the methods and variables of class.

Constructor: Helps us to initialize an object of a class
	     Its name must be same as class name
	     calls automatically when we create object of a class
	     we can create more than one constructor with different parameters.

Methods: its including a class functionalities with return type or without returning value (void)

Encapsulation: Hiding variables from direct access, wrap everything in one unit
		making variables private and generate getters and setters.

Inheritance: To reuse the same code multiple time we can use this.
		achieve using extends keyword in java

		improve code readability and maintainability

Polymorphism: Many forms
		static polymorphism (method overloading :: same name different parameters)
		dynamic polymorphism (method overriding :: same method in child and parent class)
